# PokeTools (WIP)
A set of tools to help with Nuzlockes - including some popular Rom-hacks. 
It is my first large python project, and a side-project at that.

This project is currently still a massive work in progress, and is being worked on in my spare time. But right now you could say this is in its pre-alpha state, so don't expect anything fanciful or functional. 

If you have stumbled across this page - feel free to leave constructive critisism on my work, suggest features, suggest changes, and so forth - just understand I do have a specific vision for this product, so I may not incorporate those remarks.

#Special Thanks
I want to give special thanks to the [westwood project](https://github.com/EverOddish/Westwood) for its publically available data. Without the data, this project likely wouldn't have happened.
